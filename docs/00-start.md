## Google Project IDX

Recently, I've been selected to test Googles' new browser based Workspace, [Project IDX](https://idx.dev/).  I thought this might be a good opportunity to try a Next.js tutorial, combined with the [Shipixen boilerplate](https://shipixen.com/features) to document the process as I go.
