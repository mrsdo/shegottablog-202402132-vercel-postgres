## Project Goals

#### Learning by Doing!

My learning goal for 2024 is to build on my bootcamp experience at NuCamp and continue to explore the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).  I'm fascinated with understanding how Next.js, and ApolloGraphQL can be integrated with NoSQL databases.

- We'll push the new Next.js site created with shipixen to a new GitHub repo. 

- Deploy it to Vercel to create a Vercel project.

- Next, a postgres database is added to the project.

- Then, we import the updated repo into the Google Project IDX Workspace
